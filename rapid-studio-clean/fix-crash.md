# React Native Expo iOS Crash Fix Guide

## Root Cause Analysis

The 100% download crash was caused by several critical issues:

1. **React Version Incompatibility**: React 19.0.0 with React Native 0.79.6 is incompatible
2. **Missing Babel Plugin**: `react-native-reanimated/plugin` was missing from babel.config.js
3. **New Architecture Issues**: `newArchEnabled: true` with incompatible dependencies
4. **Complex Reanimated Usage**: Advanced reanimated features causing runtime crashes

## Step-by-Step Fix

### 1. Clean Install Dependencies
```bash
cd /Users/computer/rapid-studio-1/rapid-studio-clean
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install
```

### 2. Clear All Caches
```bash
npx expo start --clear
# Or if using yarn:
yarn start --clear
```

### 3. Test with Minimal App First
Temporarily replace App.tsx content with AppMinimal.tsx to verify basic functionality:
```bash
cp AppMinimal.tsx App.tsx
npx expo start --ios
```

### 4. If Minimal App Works, Test Safe SwipeDeck
Restore the main App.tsx (which now uses SafeSwipeDeck):
```bash
git checkout App.tsx  # or restore from backup
npx expo start --ios
```

### 5. If Still Crashing, Try Development Build
```bash
npx expo prebuild --clean
npx expo run:ios
```

## Key Changes Made

### package.json
- Downgraded React from 19.0.0 to 18.3.1
- Downgraded React Native from 0.79.6 to 0.76.3
- Updated react-native-reanimated to stable 3.16.1
- Updated @types/react to match React 18

### babel.config.js
- Added `react-native-reanimated/plugin` (required)
- Kept `react-native-worklets/plugin` (also required)

### app.json
- Disabled new architecture: `"newArchEnabled": false`

### metro.config.js
- Added proper Metro configuration for Expo

### Components
- Created SafeSwipeDeck using basic Animated API instead of Reanimated
- Created AppMinimal for testing basic functionality

## Testing Strategy

1. **Start with AppMinimal**: Verify basic React Native functionality
2. **Test SafeSwipeDeck**: Verify swipe functionality without complex animations
3. **Gradually add complexity**: Once stable, can add back reanimated features

## iOS-Specific Considerations

- The new architecture can cause compatibility issues with some libraries
- React 19 is not yet fully supported in React Native ecosystem
- Some reanimated features may need worklet configuration

## Alternative Solutions

If issues persist:

1. **Use Expo Go**: Test in Expo Go app first
2. **Downgrade Expo SDK**: Consider SDK 52 if SDK 53 has issues
3. **Use EAS Build**: Create development build for better debugging
4. **Check iOS Simulator**: Ensure using latest Xcode and iOS simulator

## Debug Commands

```bash
# Check for dependency conflicts
npm ls

# Clear Metro cache
npx expo start --clear

# Reset project
npx expo prebuild --clean

# Check iOS logs
npx expo run:ios --device
```
