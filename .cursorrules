# Claude Context Rules

## Always check these files for latest project state:
- .claude-context/RECENT_ACTIVITY.md - Latest commits and changes
- .claude-context/GIT_STATUS.md - Current git state
- .claude-context/SYSTEM_STATUS.md - System resources
- .claude-context/DOCKER_STATUS.md - Running containers
- .claude-context/PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md - Full directory structure

## When asked about "recent changes" or "what's happening":
1. Read RECENT_ACTIVITY.md first
2. Check GIT_STATUS.md for branch/commits
3. Reference PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md for structure

## This directory is auto-updated by webhook integration
